<p>CRRC is entirely volunteer-led, and relies on volunteers’ time and donations to deliver its statement of purpose. CRRC is led by the Board of Trustees, and there is a core group of volunteers who coordinate the different areas in subgroups, or are involved in behind-the-scenes operations.</p>

<p>We have a lawful basis for collecting your data as set out in the section 3, “Why we collect yourthat Information”, and for using the data for the purposes described in the section 5, “What we use your information for”.</p>

<p>Lawful basis may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where it is within our legitimate interests to process your information to further our mission, for example, for internal administrative purposes relating to volunteers. We know that under this basis of processing, we have a heightened responsibility to keep your interests central and to make sure that your rights as a data subject override our legitimate interest.</li>
  <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li>Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party. If you fail to provide this information, we may be unable to perform the contract.</li>
  <li>Where we have your consent. If we want to use your image for the purposes of our mission, then we will ask you to consent to that use. Very occasionally, we will also process other areas of sensitive personal data, but we will always ask for your consent to do this.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-we-share-your-information-with">WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH</h2>

  <li>Trello (see <a href="https://trello.com/privacy">Trello Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
  <li>The Co-operative Bank (see <a href="https://www.co-operativebank.co.uk/assets/pdf/bank/global/privacy-notice.pdf">Co-operative Bank Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
  <li>Zapier (see <a href="https://zapier.com/privacy/">Zapier Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your data will only be retained for as long as it is needed in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected. Some forms of information will be kept longer than others.</p>

<p>If no longer needed, your data will be deleted in a secure manner from all devices and systems on which it is stored.</p>

<h2 id="your-rights">YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

<p>Right of access — you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information.</p>

<p>Right to rectification — you may ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate, and you may also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or incomplete. If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant third parties with whom we have shared your data so that they may update their own records.</p>

<p>Right of portability — you have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes.</p>

<p>Right to be forgotten — you have a right to seek the erasure of your data, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information to comply with a legal obligation.</p>

<p>Right to restriction — you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate.</li>
  <li>You ask us to restrict use of it instead of deleting it.</li>
  <li>We no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims.</li>
  <li>You have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, for the purpose of protecting the rights of another person, or for public interest reasons.</li>
</ul>
