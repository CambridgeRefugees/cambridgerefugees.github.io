## About us

We are a Cambridge(shire) based organisation, founded in September 2015 as a community group and registered as charity since May 2017.

Our objectives are:

- To promote any charitable purpose for the benefit of persons who have become displaced persons or refugees from the countries of their origin or domicile by reason of hostilities, persecution, oppression, discrimination, natural disasters or other like causes, including through the relief of poverty, the advancement of education and training, and the promotion of good citizenship.

- To advance the education of the public in general about issues relating to persons who have become displaced persons or refugees from the countries of their origin or domicile by reason of hostilities, persecution, oppression, discrimination, natural disasters or other like causes.

If you are a refugee and interested in applying for any CRRC support or in joining any CRRC activity, please get in touch [via email](contactcrrc@gmail.com). We are looking forward to hearing from you!

### Activities

Our activities include the provision of a range of practical support to refugees and liaison with local stakeholders.

### Cooperation

CRRC works closely with the County Councils, City Councils, local charities, and other organisations that support and campaign around refugees, and enables the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to support refugees.

### Social events

CRRC organises social events for our beneficiaries and CRRC’s volunteers. These social events are per invitation only. Please get in touch, if you would like to be invited to a CRRC social.

### Language tuition, translation and befriending services
CRRC facilitates and provides language tuition and translation services to refugees.  CRRC offers individual sessions for adults and children, and, during school holidays, a popular programme for the whole family.  We can also help with practical support and expertise.

If you are interested in receiving language tuition, require translation services, or would like any other form of support, please contact us.

### Household needs

CRRC provides welcome packs and secures household necessities for refugees. Please get in touch to apply for support with household necessities.

### Financial support for community activities

CRRC provides funds to refugees for participation in community based social activities, e.g. sports, and for educational purposes. These grants are given in particular, but not exclusively, in support of children and women’s activities.

### Emergency hardship grant

CRRC gives emergency grants to refugees experiencing financial hardship, disaster or emergencies. Hardship payments are designed to act as short-term help for beneficiaries and are not intended to provide long-term financial support.

Please get in touch for details how to apply for a hardship grant or loan.

### Employability skills

CRRC assists displaced persons and refugees to develop employability skills and works with local employers to identify appropriate openings. Please get in touch if you are interested in developing employability skills.

### Unaccompanied children

CRRC explores fostering opportunities and other forms of support for unaccompanied refugee children. If you are an unaccompanied minor or if you seek support for a refugee minor, please get in touch.

### Campaigning

CRRC informs faith groups, community groups, politicians and other organisations and individuals where appropriate about the situation of refugees and engages them into CRRC’s projects. CRRC supports related campaigns run by students and staff at Cambridge University and Anglia Ruskin University.

### Fundraising

CRRC organises and co-organises fundraising events.

If you are a refugee and interested in applying for any CRRC support or in joining any CRRC activity, please get in touch [via email](contactcrrc@gmail.com). We look forward to hearing from you!
